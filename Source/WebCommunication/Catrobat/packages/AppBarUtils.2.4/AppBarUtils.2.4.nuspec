    <description>AppBarUtils provides out-of-box app bar behaviors/triggers/actions for Windows Phone SDK 7.1/8.0. They enable you to do command binding (also binding for other properties) for app bar buttons/menu items, make use of the built-in Blend SDK and 3rd party behaviors, and dynamically show different app bars for different pano/pivot items or based on different page states.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Previously buttons and menu items in dynamic app bar can only execute code via command binding. It's a pity not to take advantage of existing well tested actions from Blend SDK, which is what this release tries to address.

See the demo code from CodePlex for how to use this new feature.</releaseNotes>
